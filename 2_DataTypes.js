/*Data Types in Javascript are divided into two categories:
1. Primitive Data Types
2. Non-Primitive Data Types
*/

//1. Primitive Data Types
/*Primitive Data Types are immutable and stored directly in the location that the variable accesses.
When you access a primitive data type, you work on the actual value.*/

/*Primitive Data Types include:
1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol
*/

//1. Number
/*Number represents both integer and floating point numbers.*/
let num = 10;
// console.log(typeof num); //number
